I'm a data scientist at Target, where I'm developing advertising attribution models and scalable systems for running A/B tests.

I'm particularly interested in developing methods that allow us to learn about causal relationships from large-scale observational data. Previously, I obtained an MS in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I've worked on algorithms for constructing evolutionary trees and  algebraic geometry. I've also worked in data science roles at Yahoo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Personify Inc.
