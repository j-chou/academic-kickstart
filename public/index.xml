      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen instrumental variables mentioned a lot from
reading the econometrics literature, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that
that I began to see how natural of a tool it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is like this. We want to estimate the average effect of a binary treatment $X$ (like exposure to an ad) on an outcome $Y$ (like sales). Suppose for two weeks we track a group of people and whether they were exposed to the ad ($X = 1$) or not (($X = 0$) and what their sales were in a subsequent period. We decide to fit a linear regression model to the data:
$$Y = \beta X + \epsilon$$
and assume $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X) = 0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is $\beta$ the average treatment effect of $X$ on $Y$?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost never, unless the data was collected from a carefully controlled A/B test. Basically this is because people in the treatment group ($X = 1$) are not the same as people in the control group ($X = 0$). People that saw the ad are more likely to buy than people who didn&amp;rsquo;t see the ad because of ad targeting. Our least-squares estimate $\hat{\beta}$ is likely biased upwards, and the better the ad targeting for this ad, the worse this problem becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is called &lt;em&gt;confounding&lt;/em&gt; and can be describe mathematically by letting $W$ represent
confounding variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
Y = \beta X + \gamma W + \epsilon &lt;br /&gt;
X = \alpha W + \nu
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X, W) = 0$ and $\mathbb{E}(\nu | W) = 0$. The theorem of conditional ignorability says that if the potential outcomes $Y^{1}, Y^{0}$ are conditionally independent of $X$ given $W$, then assuming $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X, W) = 0$, the least-squares estimate for $\beta$ in the model above would be an unbiased estimate for the ATE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in theory, if you were for example Google, you could achieve conditional ignorability by taking all the variables $W$ you fed into your algorithms for ad targeting and model just $Y = \beta X + \gamma W + \epsilon$ and get an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect. There are two issues: you&amp;rsquo;re usually not Google and don&amp;rsquo;t have the data to adequately control for confounding. Second, even if you are Google, the algorithms used for ad targeting are enormously complex and rely on a large number of variables that may not even be clearly tracked. What else can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the happy case where you have an &lt;em&gt;instrumental variable&lt;/em&gt;, you can stil get unbiased estimates of the ATE without even modeling the confounding. An instrumental variable is just a variable that causes the treatment $X$ but doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect $Y$ except through $X$:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
Y = \beta X + \gamma W + \epsilon &lt;br /&gt;
X = \alpha W + \eta Z + \nu
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restate the issue, we cannot get unbiased estimates for $\beta$ in the model above, because we don&amp;rsquo;t have good knowledge of $W$. The idea behind IV is that we can measure how a change in the instrument $Z$ induces a change in the outcome $Y$. You can think about it like this: we&amp;rsquo;re trying to measure the partial derivative of $Y$ with respect to $X$: $\beta = \partial Y / \partial X$.
Let&amp;rsquo;s think about $\partial Y / \partial W$ for a moment. From the chain rule we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial Y} {\partial X} \frac{\partial X}{\partial W}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so rearranging terms we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
\beta = \frac{\partial Y}{\partial X} &lt;br /&gt;
= \frac{ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial W} }{ \frac{\partial X}{\partial W} }
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the Wald estimator for the ATE of a binary treatment variable when you have an IV and the 2-stage least squares estimate for the ATE in the case of a continuous treatment variable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instrumental variables are a super useful tool in causal inference for getting around the problem of confounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is that we want to estimate the average effect of a treatment $X$ like exposure to an ad on an outcome $Y$ like sales. Suppose for two weeks we track a group of people and whether they were exposed to the ad ($X = 1$) or not (($X = 0$) and what their sales were over the next month. We decide to fit a linear regression model to the data:
$$Y = \beta X + \epsilon$$
and assume $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X) = 0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is $\beta$ the average treatment effect of $X$ on $Y$?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost never, unless the data was collected from a carefully controlled A/B test. Basically this is because people in the treatment group ($X = 1$) are not the same as people in the control group ($X = 0$). People that saw the ad are more likely to buy than people who didn&amp;rsquo;t see the ad because of ad targeting. Our least-squares estimate $\hat{\beta}$ is likely biased upwards, and the better the ad targeting is for this ad, the worse this problem becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is called &lt;em&gt;confounding&lt;/em&gt; and can be described mathematically by letting $W$ represent
confounding variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
Y = \beta X + \gamma W + \epsilon &lt;br /&gt;
X = \alpha W + \nu
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X, W) = 0$ and $\mathbb{E}(\nu | W) = 0$. The theorem of conditional ignorability says that if the potential outcomes $Y^{1}, Y^{0}$ are conditionally independent of $X$ given $W$, then assuming $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon | X, W) = 0$, the least-squares estimate for $\beta$ in the model above would be an unbiased estimate for the ATE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
Y = \beta X + \gamma W + \epsilon &lt;br /&gt;
X = \alpha W + \eta Z + \nu
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram below illustrates the instrumental variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restate the issue, we cannot get unbiased estimates for $\beta$ in the model above, because we don&amp;rsquo;t have good knowledge of $W$. The idea behind IV is that we can measure how a change in the instrument $Z$ induces a change in the outcome $Y$.

&lt;p&gt;$$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial Y} {\partial X} \frac{\partial X}{\partial W}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so rearranging terms we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
\beta = \frac{\partial Y}{\partial X} &lt;br /&gt;
= \frac{ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial W} }{ \frac{\partial X}{\partial W} }
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the Wald estimator for the ATE of a binary treatment variable when you have an IV and the 2-stage least squares estimate for the ATE in the case of a continuous treatment variable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First post! I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided exactly what will exist here,
but in general you can expect to find articles on things I&amp;rsquo;ve
recently been thinking about, whether that&amp;rsquo;s statistics or math or
some interesting paper I recently read.&lt;/p&gt;
